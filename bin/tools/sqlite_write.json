  "description": "Execute a SQL write query against the sqlite database. The query can only be a write (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc). Only one write operation can run at a time; multiple parallel writes will fail with a database locked error. Only execute one write at a time (sequentially), or batch multiple writes into a single query. Since this operation modifies the database, be very careful and very confident when you call this tool.",
